					<p> I grew up in the 1980s and '90s and experienced, first-hand, the transition from analog to digital technologies. I remember having fun hooking up VCRs and CRT TVs, recording TV shows, sometimes doing live editing by pausing during the commercials(and then, hopefully remembering to unpause as soon as the program resumed). We also had a nice "hi-fi" system with separate phonograph, cassette, and receiver/amp devices. I enjoyed figuring out how the different machines connected with each other, and what all the many buttons and dials did. It was frustrating when I had trouble getting the big speakers to play the sound from the movie, or when I was on channel 4, trying to watch a VHS tape, but the switch in the back was set to channel 3. However, the sweet satisfaction that came when I was able to solve the problem and the system was operating as it was designed to do - that feeling made it all worth while. Being able to watch or listen to entertaining programs is a reward in itself, but I might have enjoyed the secondary reward of electronic engineering practice more than the entertainment.</p>
					<p> Around 1992, we got our first PC, which came with MS-DOS. I played games on 5¼ and 3½ inch floppy discs(my favorite being <i>Space Quest III</i>). Dial-up internet was the only option at the time. We used that method to connect to the World Wide Web for many years. Click here to reminisce with me:</p>

					<p>I remember in 1995, when Windows95 was unveiled to the world. In my recollection, the hype over this new OS was more than any since, including all of the "i" products(you know, pods, phones and pads, etc.) Apple had a memorable Super-Bowl commercial(which, for the record, I didn't see it upon first airing), and subsequent Apple and Microsoft OSs have much improved, along with the hardware, but the hype from Bill Gates, back in '95, supported by the news industry of the day - I have not seen its equal.</p>
					<p> I remember taking a keyboarding class in high school(or was it middle school?). My memory's a little fuzzy on the equipment, but I think we used electronic typewriters that had a rudimentary digital LCD display that could fix typos if you spotted them soon enough. In any case, they were a form of typewriter, not a PC. We also had PCs in school. Yes, I remember Oregon Trail, but I didn't get to play it that much.</p>
					<p> As a young man, most of my time on the PC...[work in progress]</p>
